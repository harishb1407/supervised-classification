This paper proposed the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify Instagram profiles as fake or real. It uses the data collected from 1000 Instagram profiles, using Instagram scraping. The classification was successfully performed with a highest accuracy of 98% obtained from RandomForest.

The following machine learning algorithms were used for performing sentiment analysis:
- RandomForest
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- AdaBoost
- Artificial Neural Network
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
